# GenomeAssemblyAnnotation
Welcome to the github main page for the Genome and Transcriptome Assembly & Organization and Annotation of Eukaryotic Genomes course individual report.
This is the work of James Kai Groff Mizoguchi for the evaluation and verification of the different scripts needed to complete the practical work.
Please note that the labelling of those scripts are assigned as such: 
- No A in the beginning of the file's name is for the genome assembly part, those who have an A in the beginnning of the file's name is for the genome annotation part.
- The numbering of the files are in order of the jobs/scripts to run if you want reproducibility.
- The general job's name is indicated after the number.
